This C++ program defines and tests various string manipulation functions.
The functions include calculating the length of a string (length),
copying one string to another (copy), 
finding the index of a character in a string (indexOf), 
extracting a substring from a string (substring), 
and replacing all occurrences of a character in a string (replace).
Each function is followed by test cases to validate their functionality. 
The program uses helper functions like areStringsEqual to compare strings and ensure correctness. 
The main function runs all test cases, outputting whether each test case passed or failed based on the expected results.
